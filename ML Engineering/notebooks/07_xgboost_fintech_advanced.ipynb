   "source": "# SageMaker ML Workshop: Credit Card Fraud Detection with XGBoost\n\n## Workshop Overview\n\nWelcome to this hands-on machine learning workshop! You'll learn to build a **real-world fintech fraud detection system** using **XGBoost** - the algorithm trusted by major financial institutions worldwide.\n\n### What You'll Build:\n\nA machine learning model that can:\n- ✅ Detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time\n- ✅ Minimize false positives (legitimate transactions marked as fraud)\n- ✅ Maximize fraud catch rate (true positives)\n- ✅ Handle highly imbalanced data (fraud is rare!)\n\n### What You'll Learn:\n\n1. **Environment Setup** - Install XGBoost and fintech libraries\n2. **Data Acquisition** - Download and load credit card transaction data\n3. **Data Exploration** - Deep dive into fraud patterns\n4. **Data Preprocessing** - Handle imbalanced classes\n5. **Model Training** - Build XGBoost classifier with extensive tuning\n6. **Model Evaluation** - Assess performance with fintech-specific metrics\n7. **Feature Importance** - Understand fraud indicators\n8. **Real-time Scoring** - Deploy for transaction screening\n9. **Production Deployment** - Build production-ready inference code\n\n### Real-World Application:\n\nThis same approach is used by:\n- **Credit card companies**: Real-time fraud detection\n- **Financial institutions**: Transaction monitoring and AML (Anti-Money Laundering)\n- **Payment processors**: Risk scoring for transactions\n- **Fintech startups**: User behavior analysis\n\n### Dataset:\n\nWe'll use the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from Kaggle, which contains:\n- **284,807 transactions** from European cardholders (September 2013)\n- **492 frauds** (0.172% - highly imbalanced!)\n- **Anonymized features** (PCA-transformed for privacy)\n- **Real-world challenges**: Class imbalance, feature engineering\n\n---"

    "## Section 1: Understanding XGBoost for Fraud Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is XGBoost?\n",
    "\n",
    "**XGBoost** stands for **eXtreme Gradient Boosting**. It's the #1 algorithm for fraud detection because:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Financial Institutions Choose XGBoost:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **High Accuracy**: Catches 95-99% of fraud cases\n",
    "2. **Low False Positives**: Doesn't block legitimate transactions\n",
    "3. **Fast Inference**: Makes decisions in milliseconds\n",
    "4. **Handles Imbalance**: Works even when fraud is 0.1% of transactions\n",
    "5. **Interpretable**: Explains why a transaction was flagged\n",
    "6. **Production-Ready**: Scales to millions of transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Does XGBoost Work? (Financial Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're a fraud analyst:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional Approach** (Single Rule):\n",
    "- \"Flag transactions over $1,000 from new locations\"\n",
    "- **Problem**: Misses sophisticated fraud, blocks legitimate travel purchases\n",
    "\n",
    "**XGBoost Approach** (Ensemble of 100+ \"Expert Analysts\"):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Analyst 1**: \"This looks fraudulent because amount is unusual for this merchant\"\n",
    "2. **Analyst 2**: \"Actually, let me check - this customer travels frequently, so new location is normal\"\n",
    "3. **Analyst 3**: \"But wait - the transaction velocity is suspicious (10 transactions in 5 minutes)\"\n",
    "4. **Analyst 4**: \"And the device fingerprint doesn't match customer's usual devices\"\n",
    "5. **Continue for 100+ analysts...**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Decision**: Combines wisdom of all analysts, weighted by their accuracy\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical: How Boosting Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 1: Build Tree 1 → Catches obvious fraud (60% accuracy)\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "Step 2: Find what Tree 1 missed → Build Tree 2 to catch those (70% accuracy)\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "Step 3: Find what Trees 1+2 missed → Build Tree 3 (80% accuracy)\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "Continue for 100-1000 trees...\n",
    "        ↓\n",
    "Final Model: Combines all trees → 95%+ accuracy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tree **learns from the mistakes** of previous trees!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### XGBoost vs Other Algorithms (Fraud Detection Context):\n",
    "\n",
    "| Algorithm | Fraud Detection Accuracy | False Positive Rate | Inference Speed | Imbalance Handling |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| **XGBoost** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (95-99%) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Low | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Fast | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent |\n",
    "| Random Forest | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (90-95%) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Low | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Good |\n",
    "| Logistic Regression | ⭐⭐⭐ (75-85%) | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Fast | ⭐⭐ Poor |\n",
    "| Neural Networks | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (90-95%) | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | ⭐⭐ Slow | ⭐⭐⭐ Fair |\n",
    "| Rule-Based | ⭐⭐ (60-70%) | ⭐ High | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Fast | ⭐ Very Poor |\n",
